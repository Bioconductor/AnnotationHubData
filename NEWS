CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o add makeEnsemblTwoBit()

    o add hubError(), hubError<- generics and methods

    o create 'HubMetadata' class which 'AnnotationHubMetadata' inherits from

MODIFICATIONS

    o export ensemblFastaToTwoBitFile()

    o modifications due to changes in httr::HEAD():
      - AFAICT httr::HEAD() >= 1.1.0 accepts https only, not ftp
      - use xml2 instead of XML for parsing (httr >= 1.1.0 dependency change)

    o work on recipes:
      - clean up ChEA and Gencode
      - don't export tracksToUpdate(); was broken and not used
      - reorg man pages; combine Ensembl Fasta and TwoBit on single man page

    o work on updateResources():
      - push data to S3 before inserting metadata in db
      - isolate pushResources() and pushMetadata() from updateResources()
      - NOTE: Epigenome unit test is failing due to bad url. If not fixed by
        the host the recipe will need to change.

    o update makedbSNPVCF() to look in new clinvar location

BUG FIXES

    o fix bugs in makedbSNPVCF() recipe related to genome and tags


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o ENSEMBL recipes discover gtf files on Windows.

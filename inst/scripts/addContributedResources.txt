## Contributed Annotations:

This doc describes how to add contributed (i.e., non-core generated)
resources to AnnotationHub. In general, these instructions pertain
to core team members only.

* Case 1: Single resources with no accompanying software package

- Metadata

  Author follows these instructions to create a .R file that generates
  metadata for the resource(s):

  http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHubData/inst/doc/IntroductionToAnnotationHubData.html#individual-resources

- Test metadata

  Test the .R file provided by the author with
  AnnotationHubData::AnnotationHubMetadata(). Confirm the metadata fields
  are valid (reasonable title, version) and the paths are accurate.

- Add metadata

  Add the metadata to the production database with the AnnotationHub docker.


* Case 2: Family of resources with accompanying software package

- Software package

  Author creates a software package according to guidelines here:

  http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHubData/inst/doc/IntroductionToAnnotationHubData.html#family-of-resources

- Test metadata

  Check the metadata with AnnotationHubData::makeAnnnotationHubMetadata().
  There can be more than one metadata.csv file, e.g., ensembl_version86.csv,
  ensembl_version87.csv etc. The package should have record of all
  metadata added over time. For example, when version 88 files are added
  they should not remove the csv files for versions 86 and 87.

- Add resources

  The resources can be 'stored' on a web site or in an S3 bucket. If they 
  will be in S3, follow these steps:

  -- Create a new S3 bucket under annotationhub/ with the same name as the 
     software package.
  -- Either the core team member adds the resources to the S3 bucket or 
     the contributor adds them as the AnnotationContributor user. See the
     AnnotationHubData vignette for more details on the AnnotationContributor
     user.

     Once the resources are in the proper place, confirm they are public and 
     can be downloaded by anyone.

- Add metadata

  Add the metadata to the production database with the AnnotationHub docker.

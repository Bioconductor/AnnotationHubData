# Overview

The AnnotationHubData package package provides tools to acquire, annotate,
convert and store data for use in Bioconductor's `AnnotationHub`. Most of the
functions will be used by the Bioconcutor Core Team. For information on how to
use `AnnotationHub` or how to create an `AnnotationHub` package please see the
vignettes in `AnnotationHub`. 

# Historical vignettes

The process for adding data to `AnnotationHub` has evolved substantially since
the first vignettes were written. Much of the information contained in those
documents is outdated or applicable only to repeat-run recipes added to the
code base. These documents have been retained for historical purposes and
are located in the inst/scripts/ directory of the `AnnotationHubData` package.
